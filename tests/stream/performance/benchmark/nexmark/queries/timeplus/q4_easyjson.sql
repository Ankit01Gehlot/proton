-- Query 4: Average Price for a Category
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Select the average of the wining bid prices for all auctions in each category.
-- Illustrates complex join and aggregation.
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- TODO: streaming join doesn't support rowtime attribute in input, this should be fixed by FLINK-18651.
--  As a workaround, we re-create a new view without rowtime attribute for now.
--  EasyJson.
